## 👋 hello sasha

This repository is to teach you how to create your own content.


## 👀 looking for engagement

I am looking for ways to engage with you in a fun way.


## 🧑‍🎓 resources

You would need to the following from your computer:

- Create a 
[github](http://github.com) account
- Install 
[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/download_thanks?target=mac)
- Install 
[iTerm2](https://iterm2.com)
- Install `xcode` from `iTerm2` 
```sh
xcode-select --install
```
- Verify that you have `git` installed in your terminal
```sh
git
```

It seems like a lot of stuff, but all of this is only needed once


## 🦸 coolness

Maybe this could help you organize and keep track of your things.
